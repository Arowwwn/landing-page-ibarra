However, I will remind you that by being toxic or going into a game with a negative attitude, it will negatively impact your teammates and they may play badly or maybe not play at all. Try to be as positive as you can or simply mute yourself when you are about to say something negative." />
      <Feature title="Education" text="Riot Games North America and the Riot Scholastic Association of America (RSAA) announced plans to create a collegiate VALORANT ecosystem. They will work with colleges nationwide in order to create a robust ecosystem for all who participate. The intention is to have this infrastructure in place to have a vibrant collegiate VALORANT scene.

With a Board of Advisors of professionals in the education sector, the RSAA prioritizes growing the esports ecosystem. They’re excited to be bringing this level of expertise to VALORANT. Since the games are vastly different, there will be differences in how the collegiate VALORANT esports infrastructure comes together. However, their goal remains the same, built upon the RSAA’s three pillars: Students First, Long-term Stability, and Competitive Integrity." />
